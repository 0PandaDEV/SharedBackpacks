  This plugin enables you to effortlessly create and handle backpacks that can be shared among multiple players. The GUIs allow you to create and delete backpacks, as well as add and remove members. SharedBackpacks can assist you in sharing items with other players without having to drop them.

  - A permission plugin is highly recommended, for example [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/), as it can manage all permissions.
  - SharedBackpacks runs on Bukkit, Spigot, Paper and [Purpur (recommended)](https://purpurmc.org/).
  - SharedBackpacks supports 1.13-1.19.x.
