SharedBackpacks allows players to create and manage backpacks, which are essentially inventories that can be shared among multiple players. The plugin provides functionality for creating and deleting backpacks, adding and removing members.

- A permission plugin is highly recommended, for example [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/), as it can manage all permissions.
- SharedBackpacks runs on Bukkit, Spigot, Paper and [Purpur (recommended)](https://purpurmc.org/).
- SharedBackpacks supports 1.13-1.19.x.
